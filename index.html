  <p> More and more studies are researching the effects of unlimited screen time. Preliminary data shows that increased screen time can produce a host of physical and emotional symptoms for users. While screens are an inescapable part of our work and social life, experts recommend exploring ways to limit your screen time.</p>
  <p>
  Here are four benefits of stepping away from your screens.

  <h3><center> UNDISRUPTED SLEEP </center></h3>
<p> Constant exposure to screens (smartphones, computers, television) can disrupt sleep. A high dependency on screens is linked to trouble falling asleep, as well as difficulty staying asleep. It's important to consider what time it is when you're on your screens. Exposure to blue and intense light at night before bed may inhibit melatonin - the hormone that tells your brain it's time for sleep - from being produced, disrupting your ability to get good, deep sleep. About one in five teenagers report being awakened by their cell phones at least a few times throughout the night.
</p>

<p>For undisrupted sleep, try putting your screens away at least one hour before you go to bed.</p>

  <h3><center> NECK & BACK PAIN RELIEF </center></h3>
<p> While screeen use doesn't require you to be sitting down, users often engage with screens while sitting or laying down, which can lead to chronic joint pain. Poor posture, eye strain, increased tension in the neck and shoulders, and wrist pain are some potential health conseqeunces of long periods of sedentary interaction with screens.
</p>
<p>Experts say if long stretches of sedentary activity are unavoidable, try to get up and stretch every 20 minutes to give your back, neck and eyes a break.

  <h3><center> IMPROVED MENTAL HEALTH </center></h3>
<p> Interrupted sleep is often a sympton that appears before symptoms of anxiety and depression. Phone dependency can breed anxiety and obsession around receiving messages and waiting for likes. Online harassment on social media can also result in poorer mental health, from increased mood swings to suicidal ideation or self-harm.
</p>
<p> Teens are the most vulnerable to developing poor self-image as a result of unlimited social media use. Of course, other research has shown the positive side effects of social media, such as increased social activity and an increase in user's sense of freedom of expression. Therefore, experts recommend balancing your time on social media to prevent damaged mental health.

  <h3><center> INCREASED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY </center></h3>
<p> Physical inactivity is the leading risk factor for heart disease. Limiting your screen time makes you more likely to engage in physical activity, from walking, to dancing, to playing sports. One study performed in China in 2019 revealed that increased physical activity helped people gain self-control over their hours and hours of screen time. The relationship between physical exercise and phone dependency requires more research.
  </p>

<p> Still, in an effort to limit your screen time, you might want to consider making time each day to leave your phone at home and take a walk.
